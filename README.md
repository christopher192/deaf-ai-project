These projects aim to bridge the communication gap between the deaf or hearing-impaired and hearing communities. By leveraging artificial intelligence and other technologies, the experience of communicating with individuals who are not familiar with sign language can be enhanced. Even with cochlear implants, communication limitations can vary depending on the individual; some may excel at perceiving high-pitched sounds, others at low-pitched sounds, and a fortunate few at both. Additionally, these projects aim to improve various aspects of life for hearing-impaired individuals, such as participating in virtual meetings and other communication-related activities. Although this is currently a voluntary task, I hope to eventually convert it into a product that can be integrated with various devices and apps at no cost.
